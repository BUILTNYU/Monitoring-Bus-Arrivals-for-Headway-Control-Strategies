# Monitoring Bus Arrivals for Headway Control Strategies
In these recent years, transit agencies like the NY Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) have collected real time vehicle location data by installing the tracking devices on each bus. While several tools have been developed by researchers for extracting bus locations and visualizing them on a GIS platform, no tool has been developed to monitor the bus arrivals at a bus stop. A method is explored to extract the location data and monitor bus arrivals at each stop of a transit route to allow for network-wide headway Control strategies.
